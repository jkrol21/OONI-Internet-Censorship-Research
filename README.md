# OONI Internet Censorship Research
- Scripts for working with OONI data to investigate internet censorship

In the scope of a group project we have investigated the extent of internet censorship in the UK. 
To do so we used the publicly available measurement reports from probes running the [Open Observatory of Network Interference (OONI)](https://ooni.org/) software.
